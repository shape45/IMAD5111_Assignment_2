READ ME INFO 
Creating a dog app that tracks the progress and assesses the pets health through happiness and through its behavior such as this app will enable and provide pet owners with new insights and helping them to monitor their dogs well-being proactively. And precisely. In this, SEI will explain the input and the output of the mechanisms and more more leather coats along of the explanation of the upcoming work and the power facilities that I use. 

Number one. 
The input mechanisms as in most of all the health assessment of the mostly the mechanic mechanism of the interval, which includes the dogs vital health and mostly its Wellness. This could involve the input. Of likely the dog to play as an exercise. Consume as an eat food intake isn't drink water most of all the additional still waiting and any other specific health condition have never been added yet. Though it is still a working process till the update of the dog app My Big Daddy Corso 2.0. As it will be a new profile for your pet to expose itself to the open world.

#2
The mood and the behavior of the dog is also tracked through its happiness and its emotional well-being. And it is very important to know if the dog is OK or not. More precisely, if it is corporate corporate table, the mood can also be incorporated through its tracking. By using the tool of the app that influence or lets the dog to show its behavior, energy levels and also interaction as a minuses or adds more from its usual habits, this information will help you know what your dog is feeling in his mental health and if it's coherent. Or applicable for it to be around you.

#3
The code that is used in the integration is mostly code clean or mainly coddling as this is used or enhanced to help program or even find loopholes for the app as it was coded and screenshotted and showed every. Evident to it and uploaded images or short videos to show the proof of the dog app working. Allowing the app to analyze the dogs physical condition, facial expressions and body language overall and mostly it's health can help you improve and provide additional insights. For the more hostility assessment, which is more liquid for the dog and yourself.

#4
Output mechanisms such as the health school based on the data provided by the user and its dog. This will generate the health, happiness and the schools represented by the dog, mostly if it is. Happy enough to play with you or show excited action on the app? The dogs dashboard will be indicating if it increases or decreases in overall. The wall being off the dock can be tracked underscores over time to observe the upcoming movement or the trend of informed decision about. The pets care of. Most of all if it is applicable or recommended for it to get a check up or for it to have any health based signs.

#5
The analysis of the trend or the recommendation of the app will be highlighted and offer new tools and highlight the dog's patterns such as its health and its mobility. The antique and the mood users can also view the historical score data to compare the performances between. A week, a day, a month and yearly and it will help optimize their pets well-being. It is also personalized and suggested for the pet and the owner, most of all to help them verify the diet, as in the intake, the exercise. The dog needs, the routine. It goes through the veterinary of checkups which is the health and the mental stimulation most of all if the feeling of the talk can also be provided on base trending and observative applicable movement of the dog.

Number six
Interactive reporting. Can be generated to Provide users with detailed breakdowns of factors influencing their dogs health and happiness. These reports can include a lot of graphical representation. The color font of the background, the charts and the insides of the input. Most of all, it can gain a deeper understanding on the pet status and help it. Drive it or make it in a fun way, as it will and it will. Cause new decisions. On the owner and the pet which is made accordingly by their conditions.

#7 The algorithm will be designed to process the input data and calculate the health and the happiness of the dog as it is coded and. Programmed to consider the weight factors of the dog's feelings, the dogs intake, the dog's mood and most of all the dogs process as it is also historical database collected through accurate scores and machine learning models. Which will help the app predict more mood and more actions.

 The info and data collect on the external API's may also be incorporated and used for the code to end any errors or also to use and enhance the app use. For example the API related to the pet care can be the products, the service, the weather, the health which will be. Put or add it on the database in the integrated and provide the additional resource and info. Most of all the integration will be broadened. All will be broadcasted out on the app scope utility to see the condition or the progress of the pet. And the owner can help and find the variables needed enough.

In conclusion, this app. Is a good developed dog app which leads health happiness through percentages that involves new approach or. Work towards the input and output of codes which can develop apps and robust codes for new implementation. Mainly by focusing and gathering relevant data. Also things like generating meaningful insights and. Data Republic City can offer actionable recommendation which can highly effect the pet and the owner in monitoring and improving the dogs well-being too careful and through conditioning practices. This is a code that can serve as a vulnerable. Most of honorable and promoting health, happiness of our loved. Pets. Is the unknown, is canines and new comparisons which will help the dog and know the category of the following canines.

Disclaimer, The the code is accurate and works precisely, just just the emulator isn't running or processing the correct way as is as the gradable error has occurred so which means there won't be a YouTube video but there will be screenshots of the code. Being accurate and safe and secure.
